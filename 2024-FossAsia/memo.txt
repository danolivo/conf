Slide 9.
- Frameworks
- Stupid questions
- Postgres basic assumption
- Raise of such middleware

Slide 10.
- Two classes of nodes: scan and other relational operations
- A lot of tools
- Complexity of low-level estimations is limit on overhead

Slide 11.
Stupid example
- Database
- the gist of the experiment
- stat don't have enough objective data to underpin the decision

Slide 12.
Database should analyse data

Slide 13.
- Users use indexes to speedup most critical queries
- If they exist we can wait a lot of queries
- Btree depends on the order and users give us a key to the order and most used columns

- Experiment definition
- senseless estimation
- meaningful estimation
- inequality problem

Slide 15.
